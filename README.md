# First-VueJS-Project

This im my first project in VueJS and I want to fetch data from wordpress websites and show them with VueJS.

Have three pages:
  1) Home page -> introduction of myself
  2) Posts -> showing posts of wordress's website
  3) Comments -> showing the comments of digiato's website (http://digiato.com/)
  
Also, I use nuxt framework.
